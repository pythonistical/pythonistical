I mostly specialize in web designing and it's development and also do some backend,cybersecurity development in Python. Currently contributing at Pieces for developers (Native/Web,AI,dev support). Visit my hidden service site on Tor network at yavi7konrrlixjyehpsjraz5zvgxq3g2dpxqfs62uo2oy2z5za4itxyd.onion (it has a game made using <b><u>CSS</u></b>, hopefully you find it fun) hosted on a local web server that I built.
